Feature: Pay what you can
  As a Loomio user
  So that I can support the project
  I would like to pay a monetary contribution to Loomio

  Scenario: Signed in user pays a monthly contribution
    Given I am logged in
    And I am on the pay what you can page
    When I choose a monthly contribution of $2
    Then I should see the SwipeHQ payment page for a monthly $2 payment
    When I fill in and submit the payment page
    Then I should see a confirmation page thanking me for my contribution

  Scenario: Signed in user pays a once-off contribution
    Given I am logged in
    And my environment is set up
    And I am on the pay what you can page
    When I choose a once-off contribution of $100
    Then I should see the SwipeHQ payment page for a once-off $100 payment
    When I fill in and submit the payment page
    Then I should see a confirmation page thanking me for my contribution
